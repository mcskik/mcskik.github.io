<h2><a id="Matchmaker">Matchmaker</a></h2>
<p>
A fuzzy matching tool to match entries from two sources whose key fields do not match exactly.
For example if you have two files / databases / Excel spreadsheets containing two sets of names and addresses that you want to match.
The names and addresses do not match exactly, they may not have been written in the same language or cultural style.
Matchmaker can match these two sets of addresses with 90% or more accuracy depending on the data quality.
This tool is written in C# .Net

<h2><a id="Differenti8">Differenti8</a></h2>

A comparison tool which compares any two text files and highlights the blocks, lines, and individual characters which are different.
Most comparison tools only go as far as highlighting which lines are different which can make it difficult to spot the differences within long lines of text.
